Predicting the likelyhood of employee turnover

Here I went indept to do features engineering before building my models  

Models were built using three different modelling technique Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Gradient boosting with Cross Fold Validation set to 5 

An extensive Exploreratory Data Analysis was carried out to get the best features for my modeling 

Also I got insight with random forest feature importance to see the important features that help make my predictions
