## File Guide

HR_data.csv :  The Human Resource dataset for this project 

Predicting _workers_retention.ipynb : Jupyter notebook for the project 

## Features Engineering Process:

Here I went indept to do features engineering before building my models  

## EDA: Exploratory Data Anaylsis: 

An extensive Exploreratory Data Analysis was carried out to get the best features for my modeling 

## Modelling Technique: 

Models were built using three different modelling technique 

Logistic Regression 

Random Forest 

Gradient boosting with Cross Fold Validation set to 5 



Also I got insight with random forest feature importance to see the important features that help make my predictions.
